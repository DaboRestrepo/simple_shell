.SH NAME
Simple Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
Simple Linux Shell program. This project is about coding a simple shell with simple usages in C.
the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and passes them to the machine to execute them through the kernel to perform. We can interact with this program through the terminal.

The library "main.h" is needed to use this function, use: #include "main.h"

.SH DESCRIPTION
It's a command line interpreter that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes commands.It has direct access to the Kernel.

.SH USAGE
All the files are to be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
You must download all the files contained in the project repository in order for this program to work.
This program must be compiled with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o

.SH EXECUTION
This Shell has 2 modes of execution: interactive and non-interactive.

This depends on what the user sents to the program.

This program detects if the input is sent through the built in echo with pipes | to execute it, which is the non-interactive Shell.

The interactive mode allows us to input and execute commands for an infinite amount of times as long as the shell is running and it's not "exit" or "EOF"(Ctrl + d).
This mode has an infinite loop that prints the prompt of our Shell (DANA#) and read any input of the user with getline.

.SH RETURN VALUES
If successful it will return 0 and execute the command. If it doesn't find a command, will return an error, and print a message with: 'No such file or directory'.

.SH FORMAT COMMANDS

This shell have been tested with the following commands that are proved to work:
/bin/ls, ls, pwd, ls -la, env, exit, (ctrl + d).
